Great example everything worked except systemctl commands
which means on restart of the instance it would not start node server

The issue is that ubuntu version

command to check ubuntu version is 
$ lsb_release -a
        No LSB modules are available.
        Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
        Description:	Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
        Release:	14.04
        Codename:	trusty

systemctl is available only on Ubuntu 15.04 onwards

upstart (service) is available on Ubuntu 14.04

Refer to deploy_upstart.sh in scripts directory in this folder

Let's try all this in a clean example - example3
